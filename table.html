 dpo col ko merger kanra 
<!--  wht is colspam  Purpose: Colspan is useful when you want to merge cells across columns to create a more complex layout or to highlight specific data.
Visual Effect: The cell with a colspan appears wider as it covers multiple columns horizontally.
Important Points:

Compatibility: Colspan is supported across all modern web browsers and is a standard feature of HTML tables.
Accessibility: While colspan can help in layout, avoid excessive use as it may affect the readability and accessibility of tabular data.
Example Walkthrough:
Consider the following HTML snippet:

html

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>Column 1, Row 1</td>
    <td>Column 2, Row 1</td>
    <td>Column 3, Row 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">Spanning 2 columns</td>
    <td>Column 3, Row 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
Explanation:
The first row of the table has three columns (<td> elements).
In the second row, the first <td> has colspan="2", so it spans across two columns. This means it occupies the space that would otherwise be taken by the first two columns (Column 1, Row 2 and Column 2, Row 2).
Conclusion:
Colspan is a straightforward HTML attribute used within table cells (<td> or <th>) to specify how many columns a cell should span horizontally. It's useful for creating more complex layouts in tables and organizing data effectively on web pages.-->
